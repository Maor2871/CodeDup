# CodeDup

CodeDup is a system designed to operate in a multi-computer environment.
One of the computers serves as the system's server, while any other computer can function as a client, an executor, or both.

A client can send a request to the system, specifying the program to execute, any additional required files, if necessary, and the number of executors needed.
The system then executes the program on the currently connected executors, adhering to the request specifications.

Clients can view the output in real-time on the monitor tab.
Meanwhile, the server can access statistics regarding the system's current activity and set limitations.
Additionally, it maintains a database for reviewing past activity.
