# CodeDup
CodeDup is a system that runs on a multiple computers environment.
One of the computers runs the system's server and any other computer can run a client, an executor or both.
A client can send a request to the system, describing the program to execute, the additional required files for
the execution if there are, and how many executors are requested.
The system executes the program on the currently connected executors, according to the request specifications.
The client can view the output live in the monitor tab.
The server can view stats about the current activity of the system and set limitations.
It also runs a data base to view old activity.

Check out the project file for all the details (Hebrew).
